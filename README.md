# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A tic tac toe game built using clean architecture practices. It utilizes Pygame for the UI. The User is able to choose between playing against an AI or another human. The user can further select the type of the strategy the ai will be using during the game: minimax or neural net. It is still a console app (infancy stage).

 Improvements currently in the process:
- implementation of a Database using PostgreSQL to allow users to retrieve previous games and analyze their moves.
- implementation of a neural network that would progressively become better as more games are played.
- WebSocket to host it on a web server where players will be able to play against each other without having to use the same computer.
